Evan changes

1: added api key to index.html 
    <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=AIzaSyBA-HMQEmr9vMPbXjQBNlSuSITDRHlzTpQ&libraries=places"></script>

2: moved Marker-with-label to a local source in index.html
    <script src="lib/markerwithlabel.min.js"></script>

3: Replaced no longer available Instagram Pictures with ones from Google Places API.  They still need some formatting.
