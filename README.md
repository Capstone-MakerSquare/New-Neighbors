# Boilerplate for MKS20 Site Deploy Assignment

This repo provides a basic foundation for working on the personal site deploy assignment. 

To get started, run `npm install`, then file up the server by running `gulp`. 

The bower_components folder has been set to client/lib, which is also in the .gitignore. 

Feel free to improve on this scaffolding and make pull requests.
